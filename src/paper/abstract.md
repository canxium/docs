## Abstract {#abstract}

Canxium is a groundbreaking blockchain platform that introduces a unique economic model driven by supply and demand dynamics. Unlike traditional blockchains with fixed supplies or inflationary/deflationary mechanisms, Canxium utilizes a demand-driven approach, where the total coin supply is determined by market demand. This dynamic system allows the blockchain to adapt and respond to real-time market conditions, making it more flexible and sustainable.

Unlike traditional models that rely on predetermined supply plans, Canxium empowers market forces to dictate the availability and value of its coins. This approach creates a more adaptable ecosystem, aligning the blockchain’s performance with the fluctuations of the market.

In addition to its economic innovation, Canxium has revolutionized blockchain technology with its unique approach to mining. The platform is committed to building a more sustainable and decentralized future. One of its most distinguishing features is the innovative concept of offline mining — an entirely new idea within the cryptocurrency space.
