## Objective Overview {#overview}

Canxium is built on the vision of creating a cryptocurrency that works like real money - accessible, stable, and decentralized. The foundation of this vision lies in aligning digital finance with the same economic principle that sustains the real economy: the stability of production costs.

Most cryptocurrencies today are hindered by models that fuel volatility or rely on centralized issuers. Fixed-supply systems like Bitcoin encourage speculation rather than everyday use, while stablecoins depend on fragile pegs and trust in banks or issuers. These limitations prevent crypto from achieving true mainstream adoption.

Canxium addresses these challenges by introducing a model where coin supply adapts to demand while production costs remain predictable. This ensures that Canxium is not only decentralized in its infrastructure, but also economically sustainable and practically usable.

Our objectives are clear:

Accessibility: enable anyone, anywhere, to participate in mining and usage without dependence on centralized pools or intermediaries.

Stability: establish a monetary system anchored in stable production costs, reducing volatility and promoting real-world usability.

Resilience: design a blockchain that adapts naturally to demand, ensuring long-term sustainability and trust.

By achieving these goals, Canxium positions itself as a new standard for digital money - one that empowers users worldwide with a dependable, future-ready currency built for broad participation and lasting adoption.
