## Accessibility and Usability {#accessibility}

Canxium’s vision is to broaden cryptocurrency accessibility and usability, making blockchain technology inclusive and practical on a global scale. To achieve this goal, we have designed an innovative cryptocurrency that introduces Retained PoW Mining — a pioneering approach aimed at extending mining accessibility to underserved regions and enhancing blockchain's reach. This feature opens new opportunities for the 40% of the global population who face barriers like limited or unreliable internet connectivity, empowering them to participate in mining activities, earn rewards, and engage with blockchain technology. By allowing offline mining, Canxium makes cryptocurrency not only more approachable but also adaptable for a wider range of users, bringing digital finance closer to communities previously left out of the crypto ecosystem.

Our design goes further, separating blockchain network operations from coin mining, a unique feature that reimagines the relationship between network activity and cryptocurrency issuance. This separation supports a demand-responsive consensus mechanism, where mining activity aligns with actual market needs. During periods of low demand, no new coins are mined, yet the blockchain remains fully operational, reducing resource consumption and minimizing unnecessary environmental impact. This approach creates a more sustainable ecosystem that mirrors real-world supply-and-demand dynamics, conserving energy and enhancing the network's resilience and efficiency.

This dual focus on accessibility and sustainability aligns with Canxium’s commitment to fostering a decentralized, inclusive, and adaptable blockchain environment that breaks down the technical and financial barriers traditionally associated with cryptocurrency. By implementing such a responsive and flexible architecture, Canxium supports the growth of a scalable, robust digital economy that values inclusivity and reliability over speculation and exclusivity.

In the sections that follow, this whitepaper will provide an in-depth exploration of Canxium’s architectural design, its underlying mechanisms, and the specific features that enable its unique capabilities. These insights lay the foundation for a blockchain ecosystem that is not only stable and secure but also aligned with the evolving needs of a diverse and global user base. Through these innovations, Canxium sets a new standard for what blockchain technology can achieve, building a bridge between digital finance and real-world accessibility, scalability, and sustainability.
