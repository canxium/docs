## Smart Contract

Canxium’s blockchain is built to support advanced smart contracts with full EVM compatibility, providing a robust platform for developing decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the network’s speed, security, and efficiency. To ensure quality and reduce spam or low-value contracts, Canxium requires a minimum fee of <span style="background-color: #ff2d00"> <strong>100 CAU to deploy a smart contract</strong></span> before Helium Fork, and 1 CAU after the Fork, excluding any associated transaction fees. This approach helps maintain a sustainable ecosystem by deterring low-quality or malicious contracts that could otherwise degrade the network’s value and reputation.

However, Canxium recognizes that deployment costs can pose a challenge for promising projects with limited funding. Therefore, Canxium is committed to fully covering the contract deployment fee for projects that meet its quality standards, supporting innovative projects that bring real value to the ecosystem. This fee structure not only ensures the quality of smart contracts on the network but also provides a primary revenue stream to fund Canxium’s ongoing operations and development.
