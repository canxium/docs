## Abstract {#abstract}

In the real economy, goods and services are produced at relatively stable costs. This principle anchors prices over time: when demand rises, production expands; when demand slows, output contracts. Stability of production costs underpins sustainable markets.

Cryptocurrencies, however, are not designed around this principle. Bitcoinâ€™s fixed issuance fuels speculation and volatility, while stablecoins depend on centralized issuers and fragile pegs. Both approaches deviate from the natural balance of supply and demand that governs real-world economics.

Canxium restores this balance. Its monetary model is built on two foundations: stable production costs and market-driven supply. Mining CAU always costs a predictable amount of energy and computation, anchoring value in the real economy. Supply, meanwhile, expands or contracts based on demand, creating an adaptive and sustainable currency system.

At the core of this design is Retained Proof-of-Work (RdPoW), an innovation that allows miners to generate and submit proofs at their discretion - either from independent computation or merged with work from other blockchains. This eliminates dependence on centralized pools, enhances decentralization, and ensures that production remains accessible to all.

By combining predictable costs, elastic supply, and decentralized mining, Canxium establishes a new paradigm for electronic cash: stable, demand-driven, and truly usable.
