# Canxium Cross-Mining Program Standards for Kaspa Mining Pools

To ensure **fair and reasonable distribution of CAU rewards**, Kaspa mining pools must adhere to the following standards to participate in the Canxium cross-mining program:  

## 1. Infrastructure Support  
- The mining pool must have the necessary infrastructure to support cross-mining and properly detect and process CAU rewards.  

## 2. Address Update Feature  
- The pool must provide a feature that allows miners to update their CAU receiving addresses.  
- This ensures that miners can directly receive their CAU rewards without additional intervention.  

## 3. Direct CAU Distribution  
- The pool must **directly distribute CAU** to miners.  
- CAU rewards **cannot be arbitrarily converted** to another cryptocurrency before distribution.  

## 4. Handling Miners Without CAU Addresses  
If a miner does not provide a CAU receiving address:  
- The mining pool may withhold up to **2.5%** of the miner’s CAU reward.  
- The remainder must be **burned or redistributed** to miners who provided CAU addresses.  
- Distributions may be made **in real-time** to incentivize other miners or retained as **rewards for future miner incentive programs**. This is **discretionary**, but the withheld CAU **cannot be seized** by the pool.  

**This is one of the most important criteria that must be met.** This ensures that the large amount of CAU from non-participating miners is properly handled to **maintain decentralization and fair CAU distribution**.  

## 5. Testing and Deployment Limitations  
- During system testing and deployment, the pool **may use miners' hashrate to mine CAU for up to 3 days**.  
- If implementation is not completed within 3 days, the pool must **pause CAU cross-mining** until it officially announces support for cross-mining to the community.  

## 6. Dedicated Canxium Receiving Address & Transparency  
- The pool must **provide and use only one Canxium address** to receive cross-mined CAU rewards.  
- Any **non-transparent activity**, if detected, will result in **a permanent ban** from the program.  
- If the address needs to be changed, the pool must **notify the Canxium team** so the data can be updated on **scan.canxium.org**.  

## 7. Pool Identity Verification  
- Mining pools must **publicly disclose their identity**, including their official website and contact details.  
- **Anonymous or unverifiable pools will not be eligible** to participate.  
- **Solo mining pools are free to operate without any constraints herein.**  
- A **solo mining pool** is a pool that provides mining services **directly to miners** without withholding any portion of the rewards.  

## 8. Reward Consistency Monitoring  
Pools will be **monitored** to detect unusual reward distributions, such as:  
  - Inconsistent payout ratios.  
  - Large pools disproportionately keeping CAU rewards.  
  - Any evidence of unfair manipulation.

If inconsistencies are found, the pool **must provide justification** or risk suspension.  

## 9. Emergency Response and Blacklisting  
If a pool **violates any of the rules** or engages in **fraudulent activities**:  
  - It will be **blacklisted** from future Canxium cross-mining programs.  
  - A **public announcement** will be made to **warn miners and other pools**.  
  - Canxium **reserves the right to take immediate action** if necessary.  

## 10. Community-Driven Dispute Resolution  
- If miners suspect a pool is **manipulating rewards or not following the rules**, they can submit a report to **projects@canxium.org**.  
- A **community review process** can be established where **independent validators** check the complaint before taking action.  

## 11. Cross-Mining Service Fees  
- **Cross-mining service fees for miners must be made public.**  
- Pools must clearly disclose any fees associated with cross-mining services, ensuring **full transparency** for miners.  

### Future Updates  

These criteria **may be updated, added, or removed in the future**, but any changes will be **announced in advance** to give mining pools sufficient time to update.  

These rules ensure **fairness, transparency, and efficiency** in Canxium’s cross-mining program, benefiting both miners and pools.
