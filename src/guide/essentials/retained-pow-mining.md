# **Retained Proof of Work Mining: A Market-Driven Innovation**  

To realize its vision of a **sustainable, demand-driven blockchain economy**, Canxium has developed **Retained Proof of Work Mining** - a revolutionary approach to mining that ensures **CAU issuance is determined by real market demand** rather than fixed supply schedules.  

Unlike traditional mining models, which follow predetermined supply curves, **RdPoW dynamically adjusts based on difficulty and participation**, ensuring a **healthy, self-regulating economy**.  

### **Two Types of Retained PoW Mining**  

1. **[Independent Mining](/guide/essentials/how-to-mine)**  
   - Miners generate **special mining transactions** defined by Canxium.  
   - They can **retain their proof of work** or **submit it immediately** to the network for rewards.  
   - This method ensures **efficient and decentralized mining**, independent of external blockchain systems.

Currently, this mining method only supports the Ethash algorithm, and may be replaced by Cross-Chain mining with ETC or ETHW in the future.

2. **[Cross-Chain Mining](/guide/essentials/how-to-cross-chain-mining)**  
   - Miners can **leverage PoW from other blockchains** (e.g., Bitcoin, Kaspa).  
   - This retained proof of work is then submitted to Canxium in exchange for **CAU rewards**.  
   - **Cross-mining integrates multiple PoW networks**, creating a broader, **interconnected mining ecosystem** while reducing redundant energy consumption.

Kaspa is the only supported chain as of now, more chains will be integrated in the future

### **A Growing, Sustainable Mining Economy**  
Since launch, **RPoW Mining has gained rapid adoption**:  

- **As of November 8, 2024**, just three months post-launch, miners had created **1,586,887 secure mining transactions**, generating **over 12,273 new CAU coins** supplied to the market: [Retained PoW Mining Contract](https://scan.canxium.org/address/0x6c6331CA2BC039996E833479b7c13Cc62Ab5c6BA)
- With the introduction of **cross-mining**, participation is expected to increase further, solidifying Canxium’s **role as a bridge between PoW blockchains**.  

### **Why Retained PoW Mining Matters**  
✔ **Market-Driven Supply Control:** CAU’s supply **adjusts dynamically** to market conditions, ensuring **sustainability**.  
✔ **Decentralized & Efficient:** RPoW allows miners to **retain and submit PoW flexibly**, optimizing resource use.  
✔ **Interoperable Mining Economy:** Cross-mining enables **PoW from different blockchains** to be repurposed, fostering integration.
