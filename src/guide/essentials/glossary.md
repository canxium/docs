[[TOC]]

### **Blockchain**
A decentralized, distributed ledger technology that securely records transactions across a network of computers. Canxium uses blockchain to ensure transparency, security, and immutability.

### **CAU**
The native cryptocurrency of the Canxium blockchain, utilized for transactions, staking, and governance within the network.

### **Consensus Mechanism**
A method used by blockchain networks to reach agreement on transaction validity. Canxium’s unique consensus model separates core operations from mining, creating a more adaptive and sustainable environment.

### **Cryptocurrency**
A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for secure transactions. Canxium is designed to make cryptocurrency more accessible, stable, and suitable for everyday use.

### **Demand-Driven Supply Mechanism**
A key feature of Canxium that adjusts the supply of CAU coins based on actual market demand, helping stabilize the coin’s value and offering a flexible economic model.

### **Decentralization**
The distribution of network control across multiple independent actors, rather than a central authority, to enhance security, transparency, and resilience. Canxium prioritizes decentralization to support inclusivity and trust.

### **Layer-One Blockchain**
A foundational blockchain that operates independently and supports its own protocols and tokenomics. Canxium is a layer-one blockchain, featuring unique architecture, demand-based supply control, and innovative consensus.

### **Mining**
The process of validating and adding transactions to the blockchain. Canxium’s *Offline Mining* allows users with limited or no internet access to participate, expanding access and decentralization.

### **Offline Mining**
A novel mining method pioneered by Canxium, allowing users with limited or no internet connectivity to mine CAU coins. This feature helps increase global accessibility and inclusivity within the blockchain ecosystem.

### **Price Volatility**
Frequent and unpredictable price changes that can hinder cryptocurrency adoption. Canxium’s demand-driven supply model aims to minimize price volatility, promoting stability for CAU users.

### **Scalability**
The capacity of a blockchain to handle increased transaction volume while maintaining performance. Canxium is built to scale effectively, supporting high transaction throughput and widespread adoption.

### **Smart Contract**
A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Canxium’s blockchain supports smart contracts to facilitate decentralized applications and services.

### **Staking**
The act of holding CAU coins to support the network, validate transactions, and earn rewards. Staking provides incentives for users to participate in the security and functionality of the Canxium ecosystem.

### **Supply Model**
The approach by which a blockchain controls its coin issuance. Canxium’s demand-driven supply model means coins are only minted based on market demand, which helps prevent extreme inflation or deflation.

### **Tokenomics**
The economic framework governing a blockchain, including supply dynamics, demand mechanisms, and user incentives. Canxium’s tokenomics emphasize stability, accessibility, and usability.

### **Volatility**
The degree of price variation in an asset over time. Canxium’s architecture addresses volatility by aligning supply with demand, helping to create a more reliable and less speculative environment.

### **Wallet**
A digital application that stores, sends, and receives CAU coins, providing users with a secure means to manage their assets on the Canxium blockchain.

### **Hashrate**
The measure of computational power used in mining or processing transactions. Canxium’s mining model ensures that miners receive consistent rewards proportional to their hashrate, regardless of network demand fluctuations.

### **Accessibility**
The ease with which a diverse range of users can participate in the Canxium blockchain. Through features like Offline Mining, Canxium enhances accessibility, aiming to reach users worldwide, including those with limited internet.

### **Mainstream Adoption**
The process by which a technology or asset becomes widely accepted and used in everyday life. Canxium aims for mainstream adoption by addressing issues like price stability, accessibility, and usability.

### **Blockchain Network Security**
The measures and protocols that protect the blockchain from malicious attacks or unauthorized access. Canxium’s decentralized architecture and consensus model enhance network security.

### **Proof of Work (PoW)**
A consensus method where miners solve complex algorithms to validate transactions. Canxium’s PoW model is enhanced with Offline Mining, making mining more accessible and inclusive.

### **Governance**
The framework through which decisions are made within the Canxium blockchain. CAU holders participate in governance by staking coins, voting on key proposals, and contributing to the platform’s development.

### **Node**
A device or computer that supports the Canxium blockchain by validating transactions, storing data, and helping maintain network security. Nodes are crucial for Canxium’s decentralization.

### **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
A financial ecosystem that operates without centralized intermediaries, using blockchain technology. Canxium’s stability and accessibility features make it a strong foundation for DeFi applications.

### **Digital Economy**
The global economic activities that operate through digital and online channels. Canxium’s accessible and demand-driven blockchain aims to support the growth of a digital economy that includes a broad user base.

### **Energy Efficiency**
A measure of the energy required for blockchain operations. Canxium’s consensus model, which adjusts mining based on demand, helps conserve energy by limiting unnecessary mining activity.

### **Transaction Throughput**
The number of transactions a blockchain network can process per second. Canxium’s scalable design enables high transaction throughput, supporting seamless user experience even with increased adoption.

### **Transparency**
The openness and visibility of blockchain transactions and operations. Canxium upholds transparency, allowing users to verify transactions, supply mechanisms, and governance actions directly on the blockchain.

### **Inclusion**
Ensuring that blockchain technology is accessible to diverse communities and individuals, regardless of geographic or economic status. Canxium’s features, like Offline Mining, reflect its commitment to a more inclusive financial ecosystem.
