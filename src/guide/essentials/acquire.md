# Dual Token System

![alt text](../../whitepaper/tokenomics/images/image.png)

Canxium introduces a unique dual-token system designed to optimize the functionality, rewards, and user experience within its ecosystem. The two tokens, **$CAU** and **$OFF**, each serve distinct and critical roles that support both the network's operational structure and its long-term sustainability.

### 1. **Native Utility Coin: $CAU**

The **$CAU** token is Canxium’s native cryptocurrency, serving as the primary utility coin within the Canxium blockchain ecosystem. It is used for a wide range of functions, including:

- **Transaction Fees**: $CAU is required to pay transaction fees on the network, enabling users to perform various operations such as transferring funds or interacting with smart contracts.
  
- **Validator Participation**: Validators need to stake **$CAU** to secure the network and participate in block creation and validation within the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.

- **Platform Benefits**: Holding $CAU offers users access to special privileges, discounts, or incentives on the platform as the ecosystem evolves.

As the backbone of Canxium's ecosystem, $CAU will drive the network's services and functions, ensuring a stable and functional economic model for users, validators, and other stakeholders.

You can buy CAU from [Mexc](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/CAU_USDT) or [Xeggex](https://xeggex.com/market/CAU_USDT) or [Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/spot/CAUUSDT)

### 2. **Mining Token: $OFF**

Canxium is pioneering the combination of both **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)** consensus mechanisms, with PoW remaining at the core of its design. After transitioning to **offline mining**, Canxium will introduce **$OFF**, a secondary token specifically for mining activities. 

- **Mining Rewards**: Miners will use the $OFF token in conjunction with mining activities. They will need to burn **$OFF** tokens with each mining transaction to have more **$CAU** rewards. This burn mechanism ensures that the value of $OFF remains integral to the mining process and further supports Canxium's economic model by introducing scarcity and incentivizing participation.

- **Offline Mining**: With the offline mining mechanism in place, miners will be able to mine new CAU coins without needing a constant internet connection, but they will still need to use $OFF to enhance their mining rewards by 5%.

This token's introduction provides a clear distinction between **network utility and mining rewards**, while also offering miners a direct method to optimize their participation and rewards in the ecosystem.
