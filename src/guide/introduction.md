## What is Canxium?

Canxium is a next-generation blockchain platform that introduces a decentralized supply control mechanism, ensuring that CAUâ€™s issuance is determined by real market demand. Unlike traditional blockchains with fixed supplies or rigid inflationary/deflationary models, Canxiumâ€™s market-driven approach allows supply to dynamically adjust, fostering a sustainable and balanced blockchain economy.

Instead of relying on predetermined supply schedules, Canxium empowers the market to regulate coin availability and value, creating an ecosystem that naturally adapts to economic conditions. This ensures greater stability, long-term viability, and resistance to speculative manipulation.

Beyond its innovative economic model, Canxium redefines mining through its Retained Proof of Work (RdPoW) system (formerly known as Offline Mining). This breakthrough concept allows miners to store and submit PoW over time, making mining more accessible, efficient, and independent of constant internet connectivity. By combining predictable mining costs, decentralized supply control, and market-driven economics, Canxium is setting a new standard for sustainable blockchain technology.

## Why Canxium?

Canxium offers a **fundamentally different approach** to blockchain technology, designed to create a **stable, sustainable, and market-oriented blockchain economy**. Hereâ€™s what sets it apart:  

ðŸ”¹ **Decentralized Supply Control**  
Unlike traditional blockchains with fixed or inflationary supplies, Canxiumâ€™s **supply adjusts dynamically** based on market demand. This innovative mechanism stabilizes value, minimizes extreme price volatility, and ensures long-term sustainability.  

ðŸ”¹ **Retained Proof of Work (RdPoW) Mining**  
Canxium **reinvents mining** by allowing miners to store and submit PoW later, eliminating the need for constant internet connectivity. This **lowers entry barriers**, enhances decentralization, and makes mining more accessible to users worldwide.  

ðŸ”¹ **Predictable & Sustainable Mining Costs**  
Canxium maintains **constant mining costs under all conditions**, ensuring a **fair and transparent** system that avoids unpredictable fluctuations. This approach **prevents excessive resource consumption** while supporting long-term network health.  

ðŸ”¹ **Smart Contract Quality Control**  
To enhance security and ecosystem quality, Canxium requires a **minimum 1 CAU fee** for creating smart contracts. This discourages spam and low-quality contracts, fostering a **trustworthy and efficient** decentralized application environment.  

ðŸ”¹ **Multi-Algorithm Compatibility**  
Canxium supports **multiple PoW algorithms simultaneously**, allowing miners to use a variety of hardware, including Bitcoin ASICs, to mine CAU efficiently.  

ðŸ”¹ **A Market-Driven, Sustainable Future**  
By combining **decentralized supply control, Retained PoW mining, and predictable costs**, Canxium creates a **healthier blockchain economy** that adapts to **real market conditions**, reducing speculative risks and ensuring long-term growth.  


| Feature                       | **Canxium PoW Coin**                                         | **Other PoW Coins (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin)**              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Retained PoW Mining Support**    | Allows mining offline, promoting wider accessibility        | Requires online access for mining and transactions          |
| **Energy Efficiency**         | Energy-conscious mining with optimized algorithms           | Often criticized for high energy consumption (especially Bitcoin) |
| **Reward Adjustment**         | Dynamic adjustment based on network demand, offering flexibility | Fixed or scheduled reward halving, reducing rewards over time |
| **Hardware Compatibility**    | Supports multiple PoW algorithms, works with diverse devices | Limited to specific hardware (e.g., Bitcoin uses ASICs)      |
| **Mining Flexibility**        | Allows diverse mining setups, no reliance on mining pools   | Often dependent on mining pools, leading to centralization  |
| **Network Resilience**        | Adaptable to a range of mining strategies, potentially more resilient to attacks | High hash power makes Bitcoin very secure but less flexible |
| **Transaction Speed**         | Optimized for faster transactions with lower fees            | Generally slower (Bitcoin), with transaction fees based on congestion |
| **Scalability**               | Designed to scale with network demand and diverse mining practices | Scalability often depends on protocol upgrades and Bitcoin's block size limit |
| **Decentralization**          | More decentralized by removing the need for mining pools     | PoW coins often become centralized in mining pools          |
| **Stability**                 | Anti-price volatility through stable mining costs            | High volatility due to fluctuating mining difficulty and rewards |

| **Decentralization**          | Fully decentralized, no central authority                    | Centralized (USDC, USDT), with DAI being partially decentralized |
| **Market Volatility**         | Higher volatility can lead to greater profit potential        | Stability limits profit-making opportunities due to pegged value |
| **Security**                  | High security through mining and decentralized consensus    | Security tied to the issuer and collateral reserves         |
| **Adoption**                  | Gaining adoption in crypto communities, for those looking for a reliable PoW coin | Already widely adopted, but limited to users seeking stability |
| **Expansion Potential**       | Can expand with market demand due to stable mining costs and high rewards | Faces high risk with expansion, as they are pegged to fiat and may face issues with liquidity and collateral reserves |

## What is Canxium's consensus?

Canxium is currently the only blockchain that simultaneously utilizes three distinct consensus algorithms, working in tandem to complement each other and minimize the shortcomings of each individual algorithm.

The three consensus algorithms in Canxium include:

Proof of Stake: Anyone can become a validator on Canxium with just 320 CAU, allowing them to validate and operate the Canxium blockchain while earning rewards.

Proof of Demand: A decentralized supply control mechanism that adjusts based on real market demand.

Proof of Work: Miners play a key role in generating new CAU tokens and can even mine offline if they wish.
