## Who maintains Canxium? {#who-maintains-canxium}

Canxium is an independent, community-driven project. It was created by [Neo Krypt](https://twitter.com/neo_krypt) in March, 2023 as a personal side project.

For some personal reasons, Neo chose to remain anonymous when building Canxium and only shared some basic information about work experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neo-krypt/).

Today, Canxium is actively maintained by [both full-time and volunteer members](/about/team), where Neo serves as the project lead.

## General Questions

**1. What is Canxium Blockchain?**  
Canxium Blockchain is a decentralized, secure platform designed to create a secure and sustainable environment for the blockchain field in general and crypto in particular, Canxium has achieved significant milestones through various consensus algorithms, such as enabling offline mining, fully decentralized coin supply control, and adapting to market demand. It utilizes a blockchain ledger to ensure transparency, security, and trust in data and asset exchanges.

**2. How does Canxium Blockchain work?**  
Canxium Blockchain operates as a distributed ledger, recording transactions across a network of nodes. Each transaction is verified through PoS consensus, and once confirmed, it's added to a block in the blockchain. 

**3. What are the benefits of using Canxium Blockchain?**  
The main benefits include enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency in transactions. It reduces the need for intermediaries, which lowers costs and minimizes delays. The blockchain’s decentralized nature also provides resilience against attacks and system failures.

Canxium also allows miners to operate entirely offline by creating special mining transactions and using various algorithms, such as Ethash and SHA-256, as proof of work. These are then sent to validators who use the PoS consensus algorithm to verify and mint new CAU coins.

**4. Who can use the Canxium Blockchain?**  
Individuals, businesses, and developers looking for a secure, decentralized platform for transactions and data exchange can use Canxium Blockchain.

**5. Is Canxium Blockchain environmentally friendly?**  
Canxium aims to be environmentally friendly by introducing innovative approaches like offline mining and proof of demand. Here’s how each of these mechanisms contributes to its sustainability goals:

- **Offline Mining**
   - **Reduced Energy Usage:** Traditional mining requires constant online connectivity and high computational power, which consumes large amounts of energy. Canxium's offline mining allows miners to conduct computations without staying connected to the network constantly, reducing continuous energy demand.
   - **Specialized Mining Transactions:** By allowing miners to operate offline through special transactions, Canxium minimizes the need for large mining setups, thus lowering the overall energy footprint of the network.
   - **Flexible Mining Algorithms:** Using algorithms like Ethash and SHA-256 in a way that’s optimized for offline processes allows Canxium to maximize efficiency and reduce waste.

- **Proof of Demand**
   - **Supply Control by Market Needs:** Instead of constantly issuing new tokens, Canxium’s coin supply is influenced by actual market demand. This reduces unnecessary token production, which in turn minimizes the computational work and resources required.
   - **Demand-based Issuance:** By aligning coin issuance with market demand, Canxium reduces over-mining and the associated energy costs, as tokens are created only as needed.

Together, these approaches allow Canxium to provide the security and decentralization benefits of blockchain without the high energy consumption typically associated with it.

## Technical Questions

**1. What consensus algorithm does Canxium Blockchain use?**  
Canxium Blockchain uses PoW, PoS and PoD to achieve consensus across its distributed network of nodes.

**2. What are Canxium token, and how can I acquire them?**  
$CAU is the native asset of the Canxium Blockchain. They can be acquired through our Canxium Swap or Mexc, Xeggex.

**4. Can developers build dApps on the Canxium Blockchain?**  
Yes, developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) on Canxium using Solidity. Our platform offers resources and tools to support dApp development.

## Transaction Questions

**1. How long does it take to process a transaction on Canxium?**  
Transactions on Canxium Blockchain typically take 6 seconds to be confirmed, depending on the network traffic and consensus algorithm.

**2. What are the transaction fees on Canxium?**  
Transaction fees vary depending on the network’s demand at the time of the transaction. Canxium strives to keep fees low to enable affordable use of the network.

**3. Can I track my transaction on the blockchain?**  
Yes, all transactions on Canxium Blockchain are transparent and publicly accessible. You can track your transaction using [Scan](https://scan.canxium.org) by entering your transaction ID.

## Security Questions

**1. Is Canxium Blockchain secure?**  
Yes, Canxium Blockchain uses advanced encryption and decentralized validation to ensure the security of the network. Each transaction is validated by multiple nodes, making it resistant to tampering and attacks.

**2. What happens if I lose access to my Canxium wallet?**  
It’s crucial to keep your private keys or recovery phrase safe. If you lose access, you may not be able to recover your assets, as Canxium does not store private keys. Always back up your wallet credentials in a secure location.

## Future Developments

**1. What are Canxium’s future plans for growth?**  
Canxium plans to expand by develop ecosystem, establish partnerships with exchanges, cold wallets, multi-chain applications..... Our goal is to provide scalable solutions and foster innovation in the blockchain space.

**2. How can I stay updated on Canxium Blockchain’s developments?**
